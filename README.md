To be able to use the react website you need to run the api and the react app separately.

## Available Scripts

To run the react app correctly you will need to install the CORS Unblock.\
[Firefox version](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/cors-unblock/)\
[Chrome version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino)\
\
This is caused because most browsers blocked the HTTP requests due to security resons.


## Run API

Before trying to run the web on a browser you have to run the API used by it.
Open in terminal the folder ./back and run the following commands.
